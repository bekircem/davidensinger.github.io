After pushing my site to **GitHub** and verifying that it worked at [davidensinger.github.io](http://davidensinger.github.io/), I then went to set up my custom domain name. The [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages) provided by GitHub is clear on the subject, but I still managed to forget about my subdomains. For more than eight hours, anyone who attempted to visit [davidensinger.com](http://davidensinger.com/) was served with a 404, which is [rather embarrassing](https://twitter.com/DavidEnsinger/status/316642135216619522) for one who makes a living as a developer.

In the interest of helping others avoid the mistakes I made, here’s a guide to setting up the DNS for GitHub pages on [Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com/?aff=32887), my registrar of choice.

## Add a CNAME File to your Repo

Create a new file and put your domain name in it. Save it as CNAME.

    yourtlddomainname.com

## Find your Host Records

Log into your Namecheap account, select the appropriate domain name, and then go to **All Host Records**.

## Set up the DNS

1. Set the **@** (used to denote the domain name for which you’re configuring the DNS) **IP Address/URL** to `username.github.io` and the **Record Type** to `CNAME (Alias)` with a **TTL** (an acronym for **Time To Live** that refers to the capability of the DNS servers to cache DNS records) of `1800`.
2. Set the **www** (the subdomain www) **IP Address/URL** to `username.github.io` and the **Record Type** to `CNAME (Alias)` with a **TTL** of `1800`.

Save and then you’re all set! Please note, however that it may take some time for the changes to the DNS to propagate.
