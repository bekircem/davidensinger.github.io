title: 'My Favorite Web Development Software'
description: 'A list, with descriptions, of my favorite web development software.'
---

I’m always interested in learning about the tools other developers use during the course of their workday. What follows is a list of my preferred software with accompanying explanations on how I use it. Hopefully this list will prove helpful to someone else! If you’ve got a suggestion for a better program, please let me know.

## Console
My preferred terminal emulator is [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/), which I mainly use for the split panes and history playback (when I do something that I shouldn’t have). I’m sure I’m just scratching the surface in regards to features, though.

## FTP Client
It’s not so often that I need to transfer files via FTP, but when I do I always use [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/). I can’t say that it’s any better than any other popular alternative, but it’s my favorite merely for the fact that I’ve been reliably using it for a long time.

## Icons
I use [Icon Slate](http://www.kodlian.com/apps/icon-slate) for creating, exporting, and packaging icons. The latter point is especially helpful for the creation of retina versions of favicons.

## Image Optimization
To optimize images I use several different programs, the use of which depends on the file format.

For alpha transparent PNGs I use [ImageAlpha](http://pngmini.com/), which allows for the conversion of “24-bit PNG to paletted 8-bit with full alpha channel.” This markedly reduces the size of large images, with no perceptible loss of quality.

For JPEGs I use [JPEGmini](http://jpegmini.com/), which also reduces file size rather dramatically. Their proprietary algorithm is superior to Photoshop’s ”Save for Web”, so I usually process the file in JPEGmini in lieu of compressing it via Photoshop.

Once I’ve processed the images with the aforementioned programs, I then make an attempt to further reduce the file size with [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com/), which supports GIFs too. This latter step often reduces file size by another few percent.

## Mobile
I have yet to do any native app development, but I do often create responsive designs. To test these in mobile browsers I use the **iOS Simulator** (via [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)) and the [Opera Mobile Emulator](http://www.opera.com/developer/mobile-emulator). These programs aren’t a substitute for the actual devices, but they are a close approximation and work well for the majority of the work I do.

## Preprocessor
I use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) to compile my **Sass** on the occasions that I don’t feel like using the command line. The program supports a multitude of languages, including Haml, Less, and CoffeeScript. It’s also really helpful for the live browser reloads. I’m looking forward to the 2.0 release, which should be out sometime soon!

## Productivity
For productivity gains within OS X, I highly recommend [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/) for window management and
[Flycut](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12) for clipboard management. Divvy makes it easy to resize windows, which is especially useful when using multiple monitors (what a first world problem, right?). Flycut saves everything that you recently copied to the clipboard and makes it easy to cycle through to paste anew.

## Source Control
For version control I prefer to use a GUI to the command line, since some tasks are easier to do through an application. I use [Cornerstone](http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/) to manage **Subversion** repositories and [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) to manage **Git** repositories. I’ve tried several other well known Git clients, but I like Tower the best.

## Text Editor
As a front end developer I don’t typically need an integrated developing environment, so [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is my text editor of choice. It’s lightning fast, easily extensible, and enables me to efficiently write code with split editing and multiple selections. I’m definitely looking forward to the 3.0 release!

## Writing
While not exactly an application for development, I use [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/) to write all my posts. It’s especially nice that **Jekyll** comes with built in support for **Markdown**, so using iA Writer only makes sense.
